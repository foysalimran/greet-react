On the CONTACT page I place bubble video 2 and so on. We can also put up to 4 videos or links in the same bubble, which is fantastic. Bubble customization is also possible, which makes it easy to match the style of the site. The possibilities are endless and the best, without paying abusive monthly fees for it. The developer is very attentive and helpful. I loved the plugin and recommend it to anyone looking for a solution like this.",
